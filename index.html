        <h2>Things that once were</h2>

        <ul role="list">
          <li>
            I scored my first full-time developer job at the
            <a href="https://www.unep-wcmc.org"
              >UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre</a
            >. The length of the name is a nice icebreaker.
          </li>
          <li>
            I started
            <a href="https://nonbinary.london">Non-binary London</a> and
            <a href="https://yorklgbthistory.org.uk"
              >York LGBTQ+ History Month</a
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            I had colourful hair for a few years, mostly shaved on the sides,
            often with patterns, symbols or words.
          </li>
          <li>
            I was a DJ at
            <a href="https://www.vauxhalltavern.com/events/event/bar-wotever"
              >Bar Wotever</a
            >
            at the
            <a href="https://www.vauxhalltavern.com">Royal Vauxhall Tavern</a>
            for a few years, and coordinator of the DJs for most of that time.
          </li>
          <li>
            I was a PhD student for two and a half years, looking at non-binary
            linguistics. I stepped away in 2019 with mixed emotions, but it was
            the right choice. Before that, I did an MA in Sociolingistics, a
            PGCert in Diversity Management and a BA in Film and Television
            Production.
          </li>
          <li>
            I felt and made a lot of things in (and maybe around) 2018, the two
            feeding off each other. I went through a breakup, went to North
            America twice for academic conferences, wrote a lot of poetry, saw
            some of my favourite jazz artists in New York, made a lot of music,
            and modelled once or twice.
          </li>
          <li>
            I've had a lot of higher education jobs in different departments:
            registry/academic quality, planning/research, careers and so on.
          </li>
          <li>
            I've done a lot of shorter, overlapping spells of activism in mostly
            queer and lefty circles.
          </li>
          <li>
            I lived in London from 2016, York from 2009, Yorkshire from 1996 and
            Sussex from 1991, if you discount time in the womb. My extended
            family are from none of these places.

            Someone once thought my name was an "into jazz" pun, which I wish
            was intentional.

            I'm distantly related to
