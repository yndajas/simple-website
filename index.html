          <li>
            I go by Ynda Jas, pronounced in-duh jass, and they/them pronouns.
          </li>
          <li>
            I work as a developer at <a href="https://www.dxw.com">dxw</a>.
          </li>
          <li>I play a lot of tennis.</li>
          <li>I've lived in Leeds since April 2023.</li>
          <li>I've been on oestrogen since February 2021.</li>
          <li>
            I've been vegan since early 2013, and not knowingly eaten meat since
            2010.
          </li>
          <li>I've got long hair again, which I had when I was a teenager.</li>

        <h2>Things that I'd like to be more current</h2>

        <ul role="list">
          <li>I'd like to get back to experimenting in the kitchen.</li>
          <li>
            I'd like to explore ethical non-monogamy a little more, after a long
            break from actively dating.
          </li>
          <li>I'd like to spend more time learning and making music things.</li>
          <li>
            I'd like to read all the books on my shelf, but I rarely read on
            paper or anything in long form.
          </li>
          <li>
            I'd like to explore other forms of sport and exercise, like
            climbing.
          </li>
          <li>
            I'd like to be more active in anti-capitalist work, but I'm not sure
            how to separate the fruitful from the indulgent.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h2>Sometimes things</h2>

        <ul role="list">
          <li>I like to study Japanese.</li>
          <li>I play a few video games, and 'hunt' trophies.</li>
          <li>
            I've come to enjoy board games quite a bit, and played once a month
            with mostly queer friends in London. I'm looking to play more in
            Leeds.
          </li>
          <li>I watch quite a lot of tennis.</li>
          <li>I like writing, when I have something worth writing about.</li>
          <li>I love making music, but music takes up space.</li>
          <li>
            I don't love proofreading (most of the time), but I'm pretty good at
            it.
          </li>

        <h2>Things that once were</h2>

        <ul role="list">
          <li>
            I scored my first full-time developer job at the UN Environment
            Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre. The length of the
            name is a nice icebreaker.
          </li>
          <li>I started Non-binary London and York LGBTQ+ History Month.</li>
          <li>
            I had colourful hair for a few years, mostly shaved on the sides,
            often with patterns, symbols or words.
          </li>
          <li>
            I was a DJ at Bar Wotever at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern for a few
            years, and coordinator of the DJs for most of that time.
          </li>
          <li>
            I was a PhD student for two and a half years, looking at non-binary
            linguistics. I stepped away in 2019 with mixed emotions, but it was
            the right choice. Before that, I did an MA in Sociolingistics, a
            PGCert in Diversity Management and a BA in Film and Television
            Production.
          </li>
          <li>
            I felt and made a lot of things in (and maybe around) 2018, the two
            feeding off each other. I went through a breakup, went to North
            America twice for academic conferences, wrote a lot of poetry, saw
            some of my favourite jazz artists in New York, made a lot of music,
            and modelled once or twice.
          </li>
          <li>
            I've had a lot of higher education jobs in different departments:
            registry/academic quality, planning/research, careers and so on.
          </li>
          <li>
            I've done a lot of shorter, overlapping spells of activism in mostly
            queer and lefty circles.
          </li>
          <li>
            I lived in London from 2016, York from 2009, Yorkshire from 1996 and
            Sussex from 1991, if you discount time in the womb. My extended
            family are from none of these places.

        <h2>Things that are trival</h2>

        <ul role="list">
          <li>
            Someone once thought my name was an "into jazz" pun, which I wish
            was intentional.
          </li>
          <li>I'm distantly related to Jim Broadbent.</li>
