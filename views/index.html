    alt="A shot of me with a fairly neutral if contented expression, folding my arms and looking off to the side and up a little. I'm sat on wooden-backed bench seating in a cafÃ©. There are cushions to my sides and two plants on high window sills behind me. It's quite bright, but my portrait is clear. I'm white and have just-past-shoulder-length hair with a fringe. I'm wearing a knitted acrylic sweater, made by my mum. It's a base of purple with colourful patterned squares of differing sizes. Natural light is shining on one side of my face, from the direction I'm looking. The image is dithered, making the colour palette artistically muted"

        I mostly listen to a mixture of hip hop, jazz, neo-soul, Afrobeat,

    <h2>Things that I'd like to be more current</h2>

    <ul role="list">

        I'd like to get back to

      </li>
      <li>
        I'd like to explore ethical non-monogamy a little more, after a long
        break from actively dating.
      </li>
      <li>
        I'd like to spend more time learning and

      <li>
        I'd like to read all the books on my shelf, but I rarely read on paper
        or anything in long form.
      </li>
      <li>
        I'd like to explore other forms of sport and exercise, like climbing.
      </li>
      <li>
        I'd like to be more active in anti-capitalist work, but I'm not sure how
        to separate the fruitful from the indulgent.

    alt="Two photos of me side by side. On the left, a photo taken by Linda Bournane Engelberth as part of her Outside the Binary project. In the photo, I'm white, slim with a bubblegum pink/blonde died fringe. The rest of my hair is in the shadows. I'm wearing a translucent green t-shirt with light floral patterning, and underneath you can see a bra which has an X-shaped support between my neck and chest, in addition to the usual parallel straps. I'm in a corner looking out a window above me to the right. The bottom left of the image is in the shadows. The other image, on the right, show a close-up of my head, with blonder hair and shaved dark hair on the sides. My eyes are deep blue and I'm wearing makeup - red and gold eye shadow, foundation, blush or bronzer and possibly some light lipstick. My head is tilted and I'm looking off to the left of the frame. I have a light blue snake print top on, but you can mostly only see the neckline. In the background is an ornate mirror with a tall candle at the bottom. The image is dithered, making the colour palette artistically muted"

    <h2>Things that once were</h2>

    <ul role="list">
      <li>
        I scored my first full-time developer job at the
        <a href="https://www.unep-wcmc.org"
          >UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre</a
        >. The length of the name is a nice icebreaker.
      </li>
      <li>
        I started
        <a href="https://nonbinary.london">Non-binary London</a> and
        <a href="https://yorklgbthistory.org.uk">York LGBTQ+ History Month</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        I had colourful hair for a few years, mostly shaved on the sides, often
        with patterns, symbols or words.
      </li>
      <li>
        I was a DJ at
        <a href="https://www.vauxhalltavern.com/events/event/bar-wotever"
          >Bar Wotever</a
        >
        at the
        <a href="https://www.vauxhalltavern.com">Royal Vauxhall Tavern</a>
        for a few years, and coordinator of the DJs for most of that time.
      </li>
      <li>
        I was a PhD student for two and a half years, looking at non-binary
        linguistics. I stepped away in 2019 with mixed emotions, but it was the
        right choice. Before that, I did an MA in Sociolingistics, a PGCert in
        Diversity Management and a BA in Film and Television Production.
      </li>
      <li>
        I felt and made a lot of things in (and maybe around) 2018, the two
        feeding off each other. I went through a breakup, went to North America
        twice for academic conferences, wrote a lot of poetry, saw some of my
        favourite jazz artists in New York, made a lot of music, and
        <a
          href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/lens/beyond-the-narrow-expectations-of-gender.html/#link-3e9c0b2f"

          >modelled once or twice</a
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        I've had a lot of higher education jobs in different departments:
        registry/academic quality, planning/research, careers and so on.
      </li>
      <li>
        I've done a lot of shorter, overlapping spells of activism in mostly
        queer and lefty circles.
      </li>
      <li>
        I lived in Leeds from 2023, London from 2016, York from 2009, Yorkshire
        from 1996 and Sussex from 1991, if you discount time in the womb. My
        extended family are from none of these places.
      </li>
      <li>
        I used to be on

    <h2>Things that are trival</h2>

    <ul role="list">
      <li>
        Someone once thought my name was an "into jazz" pun, which I wish was
        intentional.
